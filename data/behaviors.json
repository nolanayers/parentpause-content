        "emoji": "ü§Ø",
        "explanation": "Tantrums are a normal part of development, especially between ages 1-4. They occur when a child is overwhelmed by big emotions (frustration, anger, disappointment, confusion) and lacks the skills to express or manage them effectively. Triggers can include tiredness, hunger, overstimulation, or not getting what they want.",
        "childFeelings": "Your child might be feeling: Completely overwhelmed, out of control, intense frustration, anger, confusion, unheard, or powerless.",
        "empathyPrompt": "Remember, they're not *giving* you a hard time, they're *having* a hard time. Their brain's emotional control center is still under construction.",
        "sampleResponses": [
          "Stay as calm as possible yourself. Your calm presence is a powerful anchor.",
          "Ensure their safety. If they are thrashing, gently move them to a safe space or remove dangerous objects.",
          "Acknowledge their feeling (without necessarily giving in to demands): 'I see you're very upset because you wanted that toy.' or 'It's so frustrating when things don't go our way.'",
          "Use minimal words during the peak of the tantrum. They are unlikely to process complex explanations.",
          "Offer comfort once they begin to calm: 'Would you like a hug?' or simply sit nearby.",
          "Later, when calm, briefly talk about what happened and healthy ways to express feelings: 'You were so angry. Next time, you can tell me 'I'm mad!' or stomp your feet.'"

        "explanation": "True sharing (understanding and willingly participating in give-and-take) is a skill that develops gradually, often not fully grasped until age 3.5-4 or older. Toddlers are learning about 'mine' and possession is very concrete to them.",
        "childFeelings": "Your child might be feeling: Possessive ('It's MINE!'), anxious about losing a treasured item, confused about why they must give something up, or simply not understanding the concept of turn-taking yet.",
